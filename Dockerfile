# Support Fins is a buildless static SPA: three.js is vendored under web/vendor/
# and the whole app is plain ES modules loaded via an import map. There is no
# transpile/bundle step and no backend -- the image only needs to serve web/.
#
# nginx is used instead of the Python dev server because dev-server.py binds
# 127.0.0.1 (loopback only, unusable inside a container) and disables caching on
# purpose for development. nginx binds all interfaces and sets cache headers
# appropriate for an immutable image tag.
