# Infrastructure Invariants & Mechanical Guardrails

The following mechanical invariants are binding safety rules enforced across sessions and workflows:

## Invariant 13: Debug Artifact Cleanup
- **Rule**: Prior to completing a session handoff, all temporary debug scripts, scratch logs, and transient build artifacts must be sanitized or removed.

## Invariant 14: Three Strikes Rule for Troubleshooting
- **Rule**: Maximum of **three attempts** allowed to solve a specific technical error or system failure. If the third attempt fails, all modification attempts MUST stop immediately and a Deep Research Request must be compiled.

## Invariant 24: Credential Leak Scan
- **Rule**: No plain-text API keys, passwords, private tokens, or secrets may be committed or persisted in public artifacts. A secret scan must run prior to session closing.

## Invariant 28: Mechanical Mitigations for Recurring Failures
- **Rule**: Any failure identified as RECURRING must be addressed using mechanical mitigations (strict MUST/MUST NOT directives or automated scripts), not advisory comments.

## Invariant 29: Script Verification Requirement
- **Rule**: After creating or modifying helper scripts (such as Python cleaner or audit scripts), the agent MUST run a syntax check/CLI test execution before marking the task complete.

## Invariant 30: Tool Name Schema Integrity
- **Rule**: Imported skills MUST be validated against active runtime tool declarations (search_web, run_command, invoke_subagent, etc.) before integration into global config.

## Invariant 31: Python Code Generation Safety
- **Rule**: The agent MUST NOT embed Python code containing quotes or regex patterns inside PowerShell Set-Content @"..."@ heredocs. The agent MUST use native file tools or clean Python script writes to avoid string quote escaping corruption.

## Invariant 32: Strict Verification Exit Criteria
- **Rule**: When verifying script execution per Invariant 29, the agent MUST NOT accept CLI output with non-zero exit codes or usage/help messages as verification. The agent MUST execute scripts against a valid test input file and verify an exit code 0 result.

## Invariant 33: Sequential Operations Delegation Threshold
- **Rule**: The Orchestrator MUST NOT perform sequential script debugging, regex refactoring, or multi-file auditing on the main thread if the task requires more than 3 consecutive file/command operations. It MUST delegate these specialized tasks to subagents.

## Invariant 34: Orchestrator Delegation Mandate
- **Rule**: The Orchestrator agent coordinates tasks and must delegate heavy specialized sub-tasks (CVE scans, cleanups, deep research) to subagents.

## Invariant 35: Subagent Scope and Reporting
- **Rule**: Subagents operate within defined scope and must report findings back to the Orchestrator.

## Invariant 36: Invariant and Docstring Preservation
- **Rule**: Subagents must preserve existing codebase invariants and docstrings unless explicitly ordered to mutate them.

## Invariant 37: Subagent Command Exit Verification
- **Rule**: Subagents must verify all command exit codes before reporting task completion.

## Invariant 38: Three Strikes Deep Research Transition
- **Rule**: On the 3rd failed attempt to resolve a technical error or on user third-strike override, agents MUST halt all code mutations, compile all environment diagnostics, hypotheses, and logs into a structured Deep Research Request, and await verified research findings before resuming.

## Invariant 39: Evidence Before Assertions (Anti-Guessing)
- **Rule**: Agents MUST cite specific evidence (command output, API response, log line) before stating any root cause. Agents MUST NOT present a hypothesis as a conclusion or propose a fix in the same message as discovering an unverified issue.

## Invariant 40: Live Ground Truth Requirement (Anti-Stale Information)
- **Rule**: When evaluating active infrastructure state, switch port assignments, link health, or online status, agents MUST query live infrastructure (SSH, API, CLI, SNMP) rather than relying on static documentation or legacy CSV export dumps.

## Invariant 41: Anti-Simulated Tool Verification Gate
- **Rule**: Agents MUST NOT assert or imply browser rendering, UI interactions, or tool executions occurred unless backed by actual tool calls with live responses or captured image artifacts. If a tool fails to attach, agents MUST immediately notify the user.

## Invariant 42: Staged Deployment & Manual Upload Gate
- **Rule**: When deploying hardware configurations requiring manual or external staging (FTP, TFTP, file servers), file generation and device restart commands MUST be strictly decoupled into separate phases with an explicit user confirmation gate between them.

## Invariant 43: Ground Truth Entity & Acronym Verification
- **Rule**: Agents MUST verify institutional names, client identities, organization titles, and domain acronym expansions against authoritative repository documentation or device backups before scaffolding UI templates or configuration copy.
